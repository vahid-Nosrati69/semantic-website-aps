                Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal.
                Unqualified, the word football normally means the form of football that is the most popular where the
                word
                is used. Sports commonly called football include association football (known as soccer in North America
                and
                Oceania); gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian rules
                football; rugby union and rugby league; and Gaelic football. These various forms of football share to
                varying extent common origins and are known as football codes.

                There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many
                different
                parts of the world. Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of
                these
                games at English public schools during the 19th century. The expansion and cultural influence of
                the
                British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British influence outside the
                directly
                controlled Empire. By the end of the 19th century, distinct regional codes were already developing:
                Gaelic football, for example, deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional football games in
                order to maintain their heritage. In 1888, The Football League was founded in England, becoming the
                first
                of many professional football associations. During the 20th century, several of the various kinds of
                football grew to become some of the most popular team sports in the world.
